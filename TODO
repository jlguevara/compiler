Assignment to structs
DOT expressions
check that while loops only accept bool expressions

questions
if (true) {
    /* blah */
    return;     // here we have a return, but we also need to jump to after else
                // so instructions would be (return, jump)
}
else {
    /* blah */
}

where do we check if inner structs were initialized?
struct node {
    int x;
    struct node next;
};

how to handle jumps with 2 labels

multiplying big numbers
