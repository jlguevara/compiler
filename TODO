check that while loops only accept bool expressions
how to handle reading in members of structs
check that labels are correct for branch

questions
if (true) {
    /* blah */
    return;     // here we have a return, but we also need to jump to after else
                // so instructions would be (return, jump)
}
else {
    /* blah */
}

where do we check if inner structs were initialized?
struct node {
    int x;
    struct node next;
};

how to handle jumps with 2 labels

multiplying big numbers

topological sort in the presence of cycles (loops)
how to label basic block in order of execution
removing unnessary jumps after return statements

why so many loads i.e. z = x + y requires that we load x and y into new registers.  Why not just do add rx, ry, rz?
